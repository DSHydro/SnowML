How to Reproduce The Results
The results for this expirement were produced using the snowML.LSTM package in this repo. The hyperparameters were set as shown in the section below. The training/validation/huc splits are also recorded below. The expirement was then run by importing the module multi-huc-expirement.py and by calling the function run_expirement(train_hucs, val_hucs, test_hucs) Note that during training data is split into batches and shuffled for randomness, so different runs of the same expirement may result in somewhat different outcomes.
