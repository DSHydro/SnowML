# ** Expirement 1B: Increase Data Granularity **

In expirement 1B, we increased the geographic granularity of the model. Still working in the Skagit basin, we applied the proptyped LSTM model on each sub-watershed (Huc12) 
are rather than the Huc10 areas. Huc regions are defined on a nested structure, where each Huc10 watershed includes multiple smaller, Huc 12 watershed. 
All hyperparameters are unchanged between Expirement 1A and 1B. In this expirement 1B, all sub-watersheds were trained *only* using the data from that sub-watershed,
as noted below by the paramenter (pre_train_fraction = 0).  Train/test split was accomplished by reserving the final two thirds of the time period as test data. <br>

On average (aggregating to the watershed/HUC10 level), the more granular approach resulted in similar or modest improvements to test_MSE and test_KGE with the exception of waterhshed 1711000511, which showed significant drops in both goodness of fit measures using more granular data.

Inspecting the resutls at the sub-watershed level further emphasized diversion of model performance by region.  In particular, regions with a higher percentage of epheneral snow 
performed significantly worse.
