Mean Forest Cover Data is from: https://www.mrlc.gov/data/nlcd-2021-usfs-tree-canopy-cover-conus 
An example of Foret Cover for the Skagit Basin, up to the 49th parallel is below.  

For each Huc12 sub-watershed, mean forest cover is calculated by averaging over all pixels contined within the relevant huc12 geometry.
