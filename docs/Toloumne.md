This document discusses results from local training LSTM model on Huc12 sub-watersheds in [Tuolumne valley](basin_fact_sheets/Tuolumne.md).  Huc12 watershed units where epheneral snow dominates were excluded, resulting in 22 sub-watersheds for analysis.

For local training using a simple LSTM model (precipitation and air temperature as the only inputs) and using University of Arizona re-analysis data for swe estimates, resulted in median kge of ___, similar to what was observed in the non-ephemeral sub-watershed in Washington State discussed [here] (add link to Exhibit 1).
