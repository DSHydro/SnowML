## Shapefile Comparison 
**Visual of Shape File From DHSVM**

![](../basic_maps/Stilly_From_DHSVM.png)

I was unable to successful conver the shapefile given to a CRS.  But eyeballing it appears to be roughly the shape of 17110008 but excluding 171100080304

**Mean SWE Estimate Comparison - DHSVM Shapefile compared with aggregating over HUC12 shapes**
n/a - cannot calculate UCLA SWE using DHSVM shapefile without ability to convert to a known coordinate system
